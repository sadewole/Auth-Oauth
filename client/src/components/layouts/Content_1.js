              Maf√©, known in English as groundnut stew, is an iconic traditional
              African dish, popular throughout West Africa, especially of the
              Wolof people of Senegal and Gambia with the ingredients and
              flavour varying somewhat by region. This rich stew is thickened
              with ground peanuts, which gives it a wonderful sweet-salty
              flavour. It is often made with lamb or mutton but can be made with
              chicken, fish or in a vegetarian version.
